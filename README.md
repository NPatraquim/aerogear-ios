aerogear-ios
============

iOS/Objective-C client library implementation for AeroGear

Not much yet here.... Only an early draft for a potential AeroGear iOS client lib,
based on the [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/) library.

The project requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for dependency management;

## Test cases

The test case just checks a simple GET and POST request against the [AeroGear TODO app](http://todo-aerogear.rhcloud.com/)

## Getting started

Open the [AeroGear-iOS.xcworkspace](tree/master/AeroGear-iOS/AeroGear-iOS.xcworkspace), if you want to get the project...
